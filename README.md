## Overview

This assignment requires you to implement a neural network from scratch using only NumPy. You will build all components including layers, activations, optimizers, and loss functions, then train your network on MNIST or Fashion-MNIST datasets.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand forward and backward propagation
- Implement gradient computation manually
- Implement various optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adam, Nadam)
- Work with activation functions and their derivatives
- Train and evaluate neural networks
- Log experiments using Weights & Biases

## Contact

For questions or issues, please contact the teaching staff or post on the course forum.

Good luck with your implementation!
